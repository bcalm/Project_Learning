Question: How is the sql_injection works?
Answer: In Web UI when we allow user to fill some inputs than someone can fill a valid sql scripts
  and we unknowingly run that scripts inside our databases.
    eg: UserName: 105 OR 1=1

In above example someone can fill the username like this and when we will run the query it give look like this
  eg: SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 OR 1=1;

Now user can access all the data of users table because of this valid sql script;
