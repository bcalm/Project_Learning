Question:-> What is JOOQ ?
Answer:-> jOOQ is a popular Java database library, that lets you write typesafe SQL queries in Java.

Question:->How does it work?
Answer:-> We can use JOOQâ€™s code generator to connect to your database and generate Java classes that model your database tables and columns.
  Instead of writing SQL String statements with plain JDBC, you will use those generated Java classes to write your SQL queries.
jOOQ will conveniently turn these Java classes and queries into real SQL, execute them against the database and map the results back to Java code.

Question:-> What is regression testing?
Answer:-> In agile, We follow TDD principle and testing needs to develop with each spring. 
  Testers must make sure that new changes don't affect existing 
  functionality of the application. This is known as regression testing.
  Regression testing ensures that previous functionality of the application works effectively and new changes have not introduced new bugs.
  Regression tests should be employed whether there is a small localized change to the software or a larger change.
  Teams must verify that new code does not conflict with older code, and that code that has not been changed is still working as expected.
